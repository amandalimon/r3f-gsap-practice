# r3f-gsap-practice

Small practice project built while learning how to combine GSAP with React Three Fiber for interactive 3D animations.

This repository contains a simple experiment focused on integrating real-time 3D rendering with smooth GSAP-driven transitions and cursor-based interactions.

## Covered Topics

- React Three Fiber scene setup
- Three.js geometries and materials
- Texture mapping
- GSAP `quickTo` for performant property tweening
- Mouse-based rotation with smoothing (lerp)
- Frame-based animation with `useFrame`
- Postprocessing effects (Bloom, ToneMapping)
- Cursor-influenced spin speed
